Platform 0.61

* Upgrade Platform and Rest Server Base pom to Guava 12.0

* Tests for keep alives with ApacheHttpClient

Platform 0.60

* Fixed bug that prevents Rack servers from announcing

Platform 0.59

* Hibernate validator replaced with direct dependency on Apache BVal

We replaced the indirect use of the Hibernate validator with a direct
dependency on Apache BVal. Consequently, the dependency was removed
from the dependencyManagement section of the rest-server-base POM and
should be removed from the POM of any servers or libraries as it is
no longer required by Platform.

* Fixed a bug preventing V1 Events from being able to be used with HttpRequestEvents

* Check for duplicate classes in the dependency closure during builds

Starting at 0.59, any rest-server-base dependent projects will have a build
step added that ensures there are no duplicates of classes or resources on
the classpath.  Any duplicates will trigger a failure of the build and the
build output will include all the problematic classes or resources and which
packages they come from.  Using the dependency:tree build goal can help with
finding these conflicts and resolving them.

* Add JsonEventSerializer for external use

JsonEventSerializer serializes a single event in v2 format using a JsonGenerator.
The existing JsonEventWriter is not easily consumed from external projects.

* Add support for Rack servers to be able to announce with Discovery

Starting with 0.59, the configuration property "rackserver.announcement" will
set the name for the rack server to announce to discovery.  The remaining
configuration to announce with discovery is identical to rest-server-base
parented projects.

Platform 0.58

* Fixed bug that prevents Rack applications from starting

* As of release 0.55, the HttpServerModule has additional dependencies:

 - HttpEventModule
 - DiscoveryModule
 - JsonModule


Platform 0.57

* Fixed bug that prevents ServiceInventory from refreshing periodically

Platform 0.56

* Fixed bug that causes HttpRequestEvents to not be published

Platform 0.55

* In this release we have upgraded the following dependencies

  - Jackson 1.9.5

* HTTP request events

We now record an event for each HTTP request processed.  The HTTP request logging and
new event system now properly support the X-FORWARDED-FOR and X-FORWARDED-PROTO headers.

* Redesigned HTTP client

The existing HTTP client interface has been renamed to AsyncHttpClient and a new synchronous
HTTP client interface has been added in its place.  Additionally, the underlying HTTP client
engine has been replaced with Apache HTTP Components.

The HTTP client is still experimental.


Platform 0.54

This release removed the use of DocLava for generating javadocs for projects rest-server-base. 
It was triggering a bug in javadoc that prevented some projects from building successfully.


Platform 0.53

* In this release we have upgraded the following dependencies

  - Jetty 8.1.1
  - Guava 11.0.2

Jetty 8.0.3 has a bug where connections will leak in CLOSE_WAIT state if clients hang up
prematurely.

* Testing servlet filters

When developing servlet filters for use with the platform HTTP server, it is now possible
to test these filters inside the TestingHttpServer. Bind the TestingHttpServerModule into your
test injector along with the module that binds your servlet filter. 

* Rack packaging (JRuby on Rails)

The rack packaging has been substantially updated with many changes:

  - rewritten launcher that supports the new node config file
  - support only Rails 3.1+ with asset pipeline
  - add support for JMX over HTTP
  - use Bundler to require dependencies when starting application
  - no creation of .bundle directory when packaging gems
  - various bug fixes including PATH_INFO, logging, locking, resources

This release requires Rails 3.1+ rather than supporting arbitrary rack
applications. It also requires the build machine to have a Ruby installation
with all of the application gems installed. This is a temporary restriction
and will be fixed in future releases.

The build process runs "bundle exec rake assets:precompile". Please verify
that this command succeeds before running the build. The following config
change in config/application.rb is likely required to prevent the command
from trying to connect to the configured production database:

  # Only partially load application when precompiling assets
  config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

The following config changes are also required for production mode in
config/environments/production.rb:

  # Serve static assets directly from Rails
  config.serve_static_assets = true

  # Enable threaded mode
  config.threadsafe!

Future versions of the rack packaging may configure these automatically.


Platform 0.52

* Admin Http Server thread pool

The thread pool for the admin http server (for jmx over http) listener has been
separated from the main http thread pool to prevent DoS if all http threads in the main
pool get stuck.

The pool size can be controlled via the http-server.admin.threads.min and http-server.admin.threads.max
configuration properties.

* Configurable http client timeouts

Connection and read timeouts for http client are now configurable. For Discovery client, use
discovery.http-client.connect-timeout and discovery.http-client.read-timeout. For Event client,
use event.http-client.connect-timeout and event.http-client.read-timeout.

* Add external address to node info

Added node.external-address property to specify the external address (e.g., Internet routable)
to the JVM. HTTP and JMX services are announced using the existing name and a '-external' name,
so external clients can easily find the server.

Platform 0.51

* Trace token support for http requests

The http server can now deal with request trace tokens passed in via a 
request header (X-Proofpoint-TraceToken). The trace token is recorded
in the request logs and is made available to application code via a
TraceTokenManager object. If no token is provided, a new one is created
automatically.
 
To enable this functionality, simply add a dependency to
com.proofpoint.platform:trace-token and add TraceTokenModule to the list of 
guice modules for your application.

* Event fields support Map and Multimap

In addition to Iterable, the event client now supports event fields of type
java.util.Map and com.google.common.collect.Multimap. The map key type must
be java.lang.String, while the value type can be any standard supported type
or nested type (i.e. any type that is supported by Iterable).


Platform 0.50

* Library Upgrades

In this release we have upgraded the following dependencies

  - Guava 10.0.1
  - TestNG 6.2.1
  - Joda time 2.0
  - CGlib 2.2.2
  - Hibernate validation 4.2.0.Final
  - log4j-over-slf4j 1.6.2
  - Logback 0.9.30

* Log configuration via JMX

Log levels can now be configured via JMX under an mbean named
com.proofpoint.log:name=Logging. Enable this by adding LogJmxModule to your
Guice modules. The AllLevels attribute returns all explicitly configured
loggers (it excludes those with an inherited level).


Platform 0.49, Oct 14th 2011

* Library Upgrades

In this release we have upgraded the following dependencies

  - Jetty 8.0.3
  - Jackson 1.9.1

* Http server critical bugs

There are a number of bugs in versions of Jetty prior to 8.0.3 that can cause
the server to spin in a busy loop when using SSL or leak file descriptors under
certain conditions.

* Admin port

The http-based jmx connector now runs on an alternate admin port to avoid polluting
the request logs and stats when monitoring the server through jmx. For backwards
compatibility, the http listener is bound to a random port. The binding can be
overriden via the http-server.admin.port property and can be turned off via
http-server.admin.enabled.

* Service inventory

Discovery client now finds the location of available discovery servers by calling
out to a service inventory API. The location of the service inventory API is specified
via the service-inventory.uri configuration property and is provided automatically
when deploying with recent snapshot versions of Galaxy.

This feature is experimental, so the old discovery.uri property is still supported.

* PGP signing of artifacts

Projects that inherit from rest-server-base are now automatically signed with PGP on
release. To get this working, the release machine and account needs to have a PGP key
and agent configured.

See http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/01/how-to-generate-pgp-signatures-with-maven/
for more information.

* Http server request stats

The http server now exposes additional request stats via JMX under an mbean named
com.proofpoint.http:name=RequestStats.

The available stats include:
- Request count
    - Total
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average requests
      per second
- Bytes Read/Written to connection
    - Total (since server start)
    - Exponentially-weighted per-request mean, min, max, percentiles (50, 90, 99, 99.9)
      with a bias towards the past 5 minutes
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average bytes
      per second
- Request time (ms)
    - Total (since server start)
    - Exponentially-weighted per-request mean, min, max, percentiles (50, 90, 99, 99.9)
      with a bias towards the past 5 minutes
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average bytes
      per second

* Http client request stats

Event and discovery clients now expose http request stats via JMX under the
com.proofpoint.discovery.client:name=DiscoveryClient and
com.proofpoint.event.client:name=EventClient mbeans.

The available stats include:
- Request count
    - Total
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average requests
      per second
- Bytes Read/Written to connection
    - Total (since server start)
    - Exponentially-weighted per-request mean, min, max, percentiles (50, 90, 99, 99.9)
      with a bias towards the past 5 minutes
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average bytes
      per second
- Request scheduling time (ms) -- time for request to get picked up by an available worker thread.
    - Total (since server start)
    - Exponentially-weighted per-request mean, min, max, percentiles (50, 90, 99, 99.9)
      with a bias towards the past 5 minutes
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average bytes
      per second
- Scheduling time (ms) -- time for request to get picked up by an available worker thread.
    - Total (since server start)
    - Exponentially-weighted per-request mean, min, max, percentiles (50, 90, 99, 99.9)

      per second
- Response time (ms) -- time to read response
    - Total (since server start)
    - Exponentially-weighted per-request mean, min, max, percentiles (50, 90, 99, 99.9)
      with a bias towards the past 5 minutes
    - 1-minute, 5-minute and 15-minute exponentially-weighted moving average bytes
      per second


Platform 0.48, Oct 5th 2011

* Library Upgrades

In this release we have upgraded the following dependencies

  - Guava 10.0
  - Hector 0.8.0-2
  - Jersey 1.9.1
  - Jetty 8.0.1

Note: we have banned all prior versions of Guava since the former versioning
names are not understood by maven and can result in invalid combinations of
dependencies.

* Jmx over HTTP

One of the major problems we have with supporting our servers in a production
environment is accessing JMX through the firewall.  JMX uses RMI by default
and RMI binds to two random ports, so we can run multiple servers on the same
instance.  This configuration annoyance is compounded by the bidirectional
nature of the RMI protocol.  When an RMI object is published, it encodes the
local address of the server on which the object is running.  In EC2, each
server has a private IP for use within EC2 and a public address which we use for
connecting from out side of EC2.  Since the RMI object can only contain one
address, we must choose between JMX being internally or externally accessible.

We have eliminated both of these problems by writing a HTTP based JMX Remoteing
(JSR 160) connector. To add this to your server, simply add the JmxHttpRpcModule
to the Guice modules.  The following command will connect jvisualvm to the server:

  jvisualvm --cp:a jmx-http-rpc-experimental.jar \
      --openjmx service:jmx:http://<host>:<port>

Note: You must install the VisualVM-MBean plugin to see mbeans in jvisualvm



Platform 0.47, Sept 29th 2011

* EventClient and DiscoveryClient

After running some of our servers under load, we have found major memory leaks
in EventClient and DiscoveryClient due to the AsyncHttpClient.  Unfortunately,
these leaks are difficult to fix due to the complexity of this code base, so we
have replaced the use of AsyncHttpClient in these libraries with the
experimental http client.

* HttpClient

We have written a vastly simplified event client interface that supports only the
features needed by EventClient and DiscoveryClient.  The current
implementation uses java.net.URL internally but we expect this to change.  This
code base is under active development and should not be used outside of the
platform until it is stabilizes.

Platform 0.46, Sept 26th 2011

* Launcher script

This release addresses one of the recent problems we've had with our servers
running in Galaxy.  Galaxy splits the installation directory, which contains
our configuration files, from the data directory where the Java process runs.
This split makes it easy for Galaxy to upgrade servers without losing
persistent server data, but this split means it is impossible for the Java
program to locate configuration files in the installation etc directory.  We
have fixed this problem by having the launcher script symlink the etc
directory from the installation directory into the data directory, so the Java
process can find the configuration using a relative path.


Platform 0.45, Sept 22th 2011

* oss.sonatype.org

We are pleased to announce that starting with this release, all artifacts are
published to Maven Central.  You can search for our artifacts here:

  http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.proofpoint.platform%22

* HttpServer

We have added the request size to the http server log.  The new log line format
follows:

  timeStamp remoteAddress method uri user agent status contentRead contentCount requestTime

As a comparison the previous log line format was:

  timeStamp remoteAddress method uri user agent status contentCount requestTime

Additionally, we have reenabled SSL renegotiation since the underlying JVM bug
has been fixed.

* Launcher script

Starting with this release, the preferred method for passing node specific
information (e.g., id, environment, and pool) to a server is the --node-config
command line option.  The argument to this option must point to a file
containing key-value pairs encoded as 'key=value'.  The properties in this file
are simply added to the Java command line as -D parameters when launching the
server.  Parameters can still be passed to the server using -D parameters on
the launcher, and these will override any parameters in the node config file.

* JRuby on Rails

It is now possible to package a Rails application just like any other Java
platform application.  The packaged application will use the platform http
server, logging, and over time we will extend the integration to support other
platform services.  An instructional guide is currently under review and will
be included soon.


and run rack applications, such as rails, using the
platform http server.  The platform logger is automatically provided to rack and rails, and other
platform facilities can be used from within JRuby.  Simply set
rack-server-base-experimental as your parent pom, and you gain many of the same
features that exist in the rest-server-base parent pom.  An instructional guide is
currently under review and will be included soon.

* Event Client v2

The event client for the event v2 protocol has been mostly rewritten to fix
various bugs and annoyances.  Additionally, we have have expanded the allowed
event fields to include java.util.Iterable and nested simple event types.  For
Iterable, any supported type is allowed for the elements except Iterable.
Nested event types, can be any event type without a special field (e.g.,
timestamp, uuid, or host) since these are only allowed in the envelope
of the protocol.  For a full example see:

  com.proofpoint.event.client.NestedDummyEventClass

* Embedded Cassandra

Cassandra has been upgraded to 0.8.5 which addresses many internal bugs (see
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cassandra/tags/cassandra-0.8.5/CHANGES.txt
for more information).  Additional, work has been on startup reliability and
timeout configuration.

One backwards incompatible change is the default partitioner is now
ByteOrderedPartitioner instead of RandomPartitioner since most of our
application are using range queries.

* AsyncHttpClient

We have upgraded AsyncHttpClient to version 1.6.5, but since this version still
contains a memory leak we have removed it from the event client.  We are
several evaluating long term solutions to the memory leak and hope to have one
implemented in the next release.

* DataSize helper methods

The toBytes() and roundTo(Unit) helper method have been added to DataSize for
easily converting the size to a long.  These methods will throw an exception if
the size is bigger than a long in the specified unit.

* Removed Discovery JDBC

The experimental discovery based JDBC driver has been removed.  This was
originally introduced for supporting database discovery to rails, but this
feature has been rewritten in much simpler pure Ruby.

* Bug fixes
    - System out and err redirect to logging does not flush
    - Fixed race condition in embedded Cassandra lifecycle
    - Fixed error reporting in event client
    - Fixed launcher issues with spawn using 'sh -c' on Linux


Platform 0.44, Sept 22th 2011

* Bad release

Don't use this release, it is bad.

Platform 0.43, Jun 10th 2011

* JRuby on Rails integration

We've started the work support JRuby on Rails in the platform by adding a
servlet based implementation of Rack.  Work will continue in future releases.


* Bug fixes
    - Discovery client fails to reschedule refresh job in some cases




Platform 0.42, May 24th 2011

* Embedded Cassandra and testing utilities

The code is part of the cassandra-experimental module
(com.proofpoint.platform:cassandra-experimental:0.42). The server is enabled by
adding CassandraModule to your Guice injector. Configuration for the server is
encapsulated in CassandraServerConfig. Code that needs to talk to the cassandra
server (e.g., Hector) should depend on CassandraServerInfo, which exposes a
method for obtaining the RPC port that Cassandra listens on.

Here's an example of how to run a simple server with an embedded cassandra instance:


       Bootstrap bootstrap = new Bootstrap(new NodeModule(), new CassandraModule());

       try {
           Injector injector = bootstrap.initialize();
           CassandraServerInfo info = injector.getInstance(CassandraServerInfo.class);
           log.info("Cassandra server listening on port " + info.getRpcPort());
       }
       catch (Throwable e) {
           log.error(e);
           // Cassandra creates non-daemon threads that will prevent the vm from shutting down
           System.exit(1);
       }



We've also added some utilities to simplify unit testing of code that talks to
Cassandra. It is important to keep in mind that due to how Cassandra is
written, there can only be one embedded instance per VM, and it can only be
started once during the lifetime of the VM.

To use Cassandra in unit tests, use CassandraServerSetup to initialize the
embedded instance. This should be done in @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite methods
that call CassandraServerSetup.tryInitialize() and tryShutdown(), respectively.
It's important that this be done in every class that contains cassandra-based
tests. Otherwise, the initialization code  will only run if you include the
class with these methods in your unit test execution. TryInitialize() and
tryShutdown() are designed to properly handle calls from multiple
@Before/AfterSuite methods.

The server will be bound to a random port which can be obtained through the
CassandraServerInfo object. To get this object use either
CassandraServerSetup.getServerInfo() or TestingCassandraModule if your tests
require Guice.

* DataSize

We've introduced a DataSize class to the experimental module for dealing with
units of data in human-readable form (similar to Duration). It supports B, kB,
MB, GB, TB, PB and can handle conversions between these units. It's also fully
compatible with the configuration system.

* ValidationAssertions

We've also added some utilities to the experimental module to make easier to
test code that uses Bean Validation Framework annotations.
ValidationAssertions.assertValidates() and assertFailsValidation() can be used
to test that an object passes or fails validations as specified by its
annotations. Here's an example on how to use assertFailsValidation():

        assertFailsValidation(config, "maxAge", "may not be null", NotNull.class)

* Bug fixes

The following issues have been fixed:
	- Discovery client fails when consuming static announcements
	- MySQL connection timeouts using the wrong unit (ms vs s)
	- Jar manifest using the wrong file names when building snapshot versions
